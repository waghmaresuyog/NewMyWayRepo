Write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers from an array.
In the sorted array the value of the first element should be maximum, the second value should be a minimum,
third should be the second maximum, the fourth should be the second minimum and so on.
Output:
Original Array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
New Array is  :  [100, 10, 90, 20, 80, 30, 70, 40, 60, 50]
