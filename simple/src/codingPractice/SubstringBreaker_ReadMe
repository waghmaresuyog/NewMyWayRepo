Problem : Extra Characters in a String
Input: s = "darwinsbox", dictionary = ["darwin","box","darwinbox"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "darwin" from index 0 to 5 and "box" from index 7 to 9.
There is only 1 unused character (at index 6), so we return 1.

Output:
1

Process finished with exit code 0
