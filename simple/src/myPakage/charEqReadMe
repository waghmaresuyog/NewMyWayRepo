Coding Exercise Assignment1 - Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences
Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.
A string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).
Example 1:
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s


input = "abacbc";

Output:
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.4.1\bin\java.exe" "-javaagent:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.3.3\lib\idea_rt.jar=49761:C:\Program Files\JetBrains\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.3.3\bin" -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath C:\Users\suyogw\Desktop\Auto\NewMyWayRepo\simple\out\production\simple myPakage.CharEq
